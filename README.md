Project Title: Household Income Analysis

Project Description:
The "Household Income Analysis" project is a comprehensive study focused on understanding the determinants of household income. This project explores a diverse set of features, including age, work class, education level, education duration, marital status, occupation, relationship dynamics, race, gender, capital gain, capital loss, hours worked per week, native country, and income.

Through a thorough examination of these features, the project aims to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to variations in household income. By employing advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the study seeks to unveil insights into the socio-economic factors influencing income levels within households.

The analysis not only provides a nuanced understanding of the impact of individual and demographic factors on income but also offers practical implications for policymakers, economists, and social scientists. This project serves as a valuable resource for decision-makers to formulate targeted policies, address income disparities, and design interventions aimed at fostering economic well-being.

The "Household Income Analysis" project strives to contribute to the broader understanding of income dynamics, facilitating informed discussions and actions to promote economic equity and prosperity.
